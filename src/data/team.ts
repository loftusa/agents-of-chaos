/* Single source of truth for the /team page: the roster, the work, and the
 * ties between them. The evidence graph and the bio cards both render from
 * this file — the server reads it in .astro frontmatter, the client script
 * imports the same module, so the two can never drift.
 *
 * Every tie carries a `source`: a public URL (linked from the graph's detail
 * panel), "confirmed by the person", or "NDA — engagement record". Every URL
 * below was fetched and the claim read on the page (verification run,
 * 2026-06-12); rows without a public source were confirmed by Alex Loftus
 * (fact review, 2026-06-12).
 * The client lab is never named — "a frontier lab" only (site-wide rule). */
