# Agents of Chaos — site

Astro (static, zero-runtime) marketing + content site. Pages: `/` (home),
`/team` (evidence graph of the team's work), `/networks` (company-landscape
map), `/contact`.

Two interactive D3 graphs share a pattern (bundled `<script>` + d3 + a typed
data module): `/team` (`src/scripts/team-graph.ts`, data `src/data/team.ts`) and
`/networks` (`src/scripts/networks-graph.ts`, data `src/data/companies.json`).

**`/networks`** maps companies building/deploying AI agents — color = vertical,
size = deployment intensity, edges = business / shared-investor / competitor
ties. It has a **private CRM layer** (warm-intro paths + pipeline stage) in
`private/overlay.json` that is gitignored and loaded **only in `astro dev`** —
never in a production build. The dataset is built by a research pipeline; see
[`experiments/networks/README.md`](experiments/networks/README.md).

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## 📄 Papers graph (`/papers`)

An interactive relevance graph of papers we're reading. Nodes are papers, edges are
relevance, and a discovery slider nominates unread papers worth reading next.

- **Edge metric** (`src/scripts/papers-core.js`): `w = 0.65·SPECTER2-cosine + 0.25·shared-references
  + 0.10·direct-citation`, kNN-sparsified. The embedding term is always defined, so a paper's
  heaviest edge points at its most-relevant neighbour by construction.
- **Discovery slider = vertex nomination**: unread candidates (Semantic Scholar recommendations
  for your set) ranked by nearest-read cosine, with a gentle log-citation nudge so well-known
  papers surface among comparably-relevant ones (`CITE_WEIGHT` in `papers-graph.ts`, relevance
  stays primary); the slider reveals a prefix of that ranking. Click a paper to aim discovery at
  it; shift-click several to find papers closest to all of them.
- **Add a paper / hover-heat**: a new paper drops in via its own SPECTER2 vector (no re-embedding);
  hovering shades every node by relevance, scaled relative to the (compressed) cosine band.
- **Data flow**: visitors load the static `public/papers.json`, then the page **preloads the
  discovery frontier in the background** (a `loadFrontier(false)` call on load) so the first slider
  tick reveals a paper instantly instead of waiting ~3s for the network — subsequent ticks are a
  synchronous ~0.3ms render. The preload is silent (no ghosts/status until you drag). Adding a paper
  or expanding the frontier also calls `api/paper.js` — a root-level **Vercel serverless function**
  that proxies Semantic Scholar and holds the API key. If that function is unavailable (e.g.
  `astro dev`), the client falls back to calling Semantic Scholar directly (anonymous, CORS-enabled).
  *(Trade-off: the preload means a page view now makes one recommendations + one embeddings request,
  where before a pure view made none.)*

### Setup / deploy

- **`SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY`** — set this in the Vercel project env (and a local `.env`) so the
  proxy isn't rate-limited and reliably returns SPECTER2 embeddings. Without it the site still works
  via the anonymous fallback, just less reliably under load. Request a free key from Semantic Scholar.
- **Reseed the canonical graph**: edit `SEEDS` in `scripts/seed-papers.mjs`, then
  `node scripts/seed-papers.mjs` to rewrite `public/papers.json`.
- **Non-S2 documents** (e.g. the METR report — a blog/PDF, not on arXiv/Semantic Scholar) have no
  fetchable SPECTER2 vector. `uv run scripts/embed_specter2.py` embeds such a doc locally into the
  *same* space (it verifies ~0.96 cosine vs S2's vectors first) and writes `scripts/metr-embedding.json`,
  which `seed-papers.mjs` splices in as a first-class node. The deployed site never runs this.
- **Curate live**: add papers in the page (they persist to `localStorage`), then **export** →
  commit the downloaded `papers.json` to `public/` to make them part of the public graph.

### Auto-explainers (`scripts/generate-explainers.mjs`)

Every paper can have a one-page **explainer** (like the hand-built
[`/papers/metr-frontier-risk-explainer.html`](public/papers/metr-frontier-risk-explainer.html)).
`scripts/generate-explainers.mjs` reads `public/papers.json`, and for any paper not already in
`public/papers/explainers.json` it asks Claude for a **grounded** summary (using only the paper's
title/abstract/tldr — never inventing specifics) and templates it into a self-contained, site-styled
page under `public/papers/explainers/<slug>.html`. Clicking a node on `/papers` surfaces its explainer
in the detail panel (the accent "✦ our explainer" card).

- **Nightly**: [`.github/workflows/nightly-explainers.yml`](.github/workflows/nightly-explainers.yml)
  runs the script and commits any new explainers (Vercel then redeploys). It needs an
  **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** repo secret: `gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Without it the script is a
  no-op, so the workflow stays green.
- **Locally**: `node scripts/generate-explainers.mjs` (all missing) or
  `node scripts/generate-explainers.mjs <paperId>` (one, for testing). Set `EXPLAINER_MODEL` to override
  the model (default `claude-opus-4-8`). Hand-written explainers stay in the manifest with
  `"kind": "handcrafted"` and are never overwritten.
