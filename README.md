# Astro Starter Kit: Minimal

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template minimal
```

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## 📄 Papers graph (`/papers`)

An interactive relevance graph of papers we're reading. Nodes are papers, edges are
relevance, and a discovery slider nominates unread papers worth reading next.

- **Edge metric** (`src/scripts/papers-core.js`): `w = 0.65·SPECTER2-cosine + 0.25·shared-references
  + 0.10·direct-citation`, kNN-sparsified. The embedding term is always defined, so a paper's
  heaviest edge points at its most-relevant neighbour by construction.
- **Discovery slider = vertex nomination**: unread candidates (Semantic Scholar recommendations
  for your set) ranked by nearest-read cosine; the slider reveals a prefix of that ranking.
- **Add a paper / hover-heat**: a new paper drops in via its own SPECTER2 vector (no re-embedding);
  hovering shades every node by relevance, scaled relative to the (compressed) cosine band.
- **Data flow**: visitors load the static `public/papers.json` (no API calls). Adding a paper or
  expanding the frontier calls `api/paper.js` — a root-level **Vercel serverless function** that
  proxies Semantic Scholar and holds the API key. If that function is unavailable (e.g. `astro dev`),
  the client falls back to calling Semantic Scholar directly (anonymous, CORS-enabled).

### Setup / deploy

- **`SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY`** — set this in the Vercel project env (and a local `.env`) so the
  proxy isn't rate-limited and reliably returns SPECTER2 embeddings. Without it the site still works
  via the anonymous fallback, just less reliably under load. Request a free key from Semantic Scholar.
- **Reseed the canonical graph**: edit `SEEDS` in `scripts/seed-papers.mjs`, then
  `node scripts/seed-papers.mjs` to rewrite `public/papers.json`.
- **Curate live**: add papers in the page (they persist to `localStorage`), then **export** →
  commit the downloaded `papers.json` to `public/` to make them part of the public graph.
